## **Features**
### **1. Trading Strategy**
The trading strategy uses two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) with different time horizons:
- **Short-term EMA**: Captures recent price trends.
- **Long-term EMA**: Identifies overall market direction.
- **Signals**:
  - **Buy**: Triggered when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA.
  - **Sell**: Triggered when the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA.
  - No signal is generated when the EMAs overlap.

### **2. Performance Metrics**
The strategy evaluates several performance measures, including:
- **Average Return**: Mean daily return of the portfolio.
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of daily returns.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure, calculated as return-to-volatility.
- **Sortino Ratio**: Like the Sharpe ratio but penalizes only downside volatility.
- **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline during the backtesting period.
- **Hit Ratio**: Measures the accuracy of trading signals.

### **3. Advanced Features**
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Splits the data into training (in-sample) and testing (out-of-sample) periods to validate the strategy.
- **Optimization**: Allows adjustment of EMA parameters (e.g., short/long window lengths) to improve risk-adjusted returns.
- **Volatility Management**: Implements techniques to reduce portfolio volatility, such as diversification and risk-parity weighting.

## **Usage Instructions**
### **1. Data Fetching**
The project retrieves historical stock data using Yahoo Finance's API. Users can customize:
- The number of stocks in the portfolio.
- The time horizon for analysis.

### **2. Strategy Implementation**
The EMA crossover strategy determines which stocks to buy (long) and sell (short) at each trading period. It tracks portfolio positions and calculates daily returns.

### **3. Performance Analysis**
The project calculates performance metrics to evaluate the strategy's effectiveness. Users can explore:
- How the strategy performed during different market conditions.
- The contribution of long vs. short positions to overall returns.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
### **1. Flexibility**
The project is designed for extensibility, allowing users to:
- Experiment with different technical indicators.
- Adjust parameters for EMAs and other strategy components.

### **2. Risk Management**
The focus on reducing volatility rather than simply increasing returns helps boost the Sharpe ratio, demonstrating the importance of robust portfolio construction.

### **3. Practical Insights**
This project highlights:
- The trade-offs between risk and return.
- The significance of backtesting and out-of-sample validation in quantitative trading.


Hereâ€™s a detailed **README.md** file for a **Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover trading strategy**, mirroring the structure and depth of explanation provided for the EMA strategy:

# **SMA-Based Trading Strategy**

## **Overview**
This repository also implements a **Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover trading strategy** to evaluate stock portfolio performance. The strategy identifies buy and sell signals by analyzing the crossover of two moving averages with different time horizons. The repository focuses on:
- Generating trading signals using SMA crossovers.
- Backtesting the strategy on historical stock data.
- Measuring and analyzing key performance metrics to evaluate the strategy's effectiveness and risk.

The project is designed to showcase the practical application of a classic trend-following strategy in quantitative trading.

## **Features**
### **1. Trading Strategy**
The SMA crossover strategy is a popular trend-following technique based on:
- **Short-term SMA**: Reflects recent price trends over a smaller window.
- **Long-term SMA**: Captures the overall market direction using a longer window.
- **Signals**:
  - **Buy**: When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA.
  - **Sell**: When the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.
  - No action is taken when the SMAs overlap.

### **2. Performance Metrics**
The strategy evaluates several performance metrics:
- **Average Return**: Mean daily return of the portfolio.
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of daily returns, representing risk.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Evaluates risk-adjusted returns by comparing return to volatility.
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest decline from a peak in the cumulative return.
- **Hit Ratio**: Measures the accuracy of the trading signals.

### **3. Advanced Features**
- **Parameter Optimization**:
  - Fine-tune the short-term and long-term SMA windows to improve performance.
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**:
  - Validates the strategy by splitting the data into training (in-sample) and testing (out-of-sample) periods.
- **Volatility Reduction**:
  - Techniques like diversification and risk-parity allocation to enhance the Sharpe ratio.

## **Comparison to EMA Strategy**
While this repository focuses on the SMA crossover strategy, the key differences from the EMA strategy are:
1. **Calculation Method**:
   - SMAs give equal weight to all historical prices in the window.
   - EMAs assign higher weights to more recent prices, making them more responsive.
2. **Use Case**:
   - SMA strategies are better suited for longer-term trends.
   - EMA strategies are often preferred in fast-moving markets for quicker signal generation.
